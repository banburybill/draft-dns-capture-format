                   C-DNS: A DNS Packet Capture Format
                 draft-ietf-dnsop-dns-capture-format-01

Abstract

   This document describes a data representation for collections of DNS
   messages.  The format is designed for efficient storage and
   transmission of large packet captures of DNS traffic; it attempts to
   minimize the size of such packet capture files but retain the full
   DNS message contents along with the most useful transport metadata.
   It is intended to assist with the development of DNS traffic
   monitoring applications.

1.  Introduction

   There has long been a need to collect DNS queries and responses on
   authoritative and recursive name servers for monitoring and analysis.
   This data is used in a number of ways including traffic monitoring,
   analyzing network attacks and "day in the life" (DITL) [ditl]
   analysis.

   A wide variety of tools already exist that facilitate the collection
   of DNS traffic data, such as DSC [dsc], packetq [packetq], dnscap
   [dnscap] and dnstap [dnstap].  However, there is no standard exchange
   format for large DNS packet captures.  The PCAP [pcap] or PCAP-NG
   [pcapng] formats are typically used in practice for packet captures,
   but these file formats can contain a great deal of additional
   information that is not directly pertinent to DNS traffic analysis
   and thus unnecessarily increases the capture file size.

   There has also been work on using text based formats to describe DNS
   packets such as [I-D.daley-dnsxml], [I-D.hoffman-dns-in-json], but

Internet-Draft     C-DNS: A DNS Packet Capture Format      December 2016


   these are largely aimed at producing convenient representations of
   single messages.

   Many DNS operators may receive hundreds of thousands of queries per
   second on a single name server instance so a mechanism to minimize
   the storage size (and therefore upload overhead) of the data
   collected is highly desirable.

   The format described in this document, C-DNS (Compacted-DNS),
   focusses on the problem of capturing and storing large packet capture
   files of DNS traffic. with the following goals in mind:

   o  Minimize the file size for storage and transmission

   o  Minimizing the overhead of producing the packet capture file and
      the cost of any further (general purpose) compression of the file

   This document contains:

   o  A discussion of the some common use cases in which such DNS data
      is collected Section 3

   o  A discussion of the major design considerations in developing an
      efficient data representation for collections of DNS messages

   o  A conceptual overview of the C-DNS format Section 6

   o  A description of why CBOR [RFC7049] was chosen for this format

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The parts of DNS messages are named as they are in [RFC1035].  In
   specific, the DNS message has five sections: Header, Question,
   Answer, Authority, and Additional.

   Pairs of DNS messages are called a Query and a Response.

3.  Data Collection Use Cases

   In an ideal world, it would be optimal to collect full packet
   captures of all packets going in or out of a name server.  However,
   there are several design choices or other limitations that are common
   to many DNS installations and operators.

   o  DNS servers are hosted in a variety of situations

      *  Self-hosted servers

      *  Third party hosting (including multiple third parties)

      *  Third party hardware (including multiple third parties)

   o  Data is collected under different conditions

      *  On well-provisioned servers running in a steady state

      *  On heavily loaded servers

      *  On virtualized servers

      *  On servers that are under DoS attack

      *  On servers that are unwitting intermediaries in DoS attacks

   o  Traffic can be collected via a variety of mechanisms

      *  On the same hardware as the name server itself

      *  Using a network tap on an adjacent host to listen to DNS
         traffic

      *  Using port mirroring to listen from another host

   o  The capabilities of data collection (and upload) networks vary

      *  Out-of-band networks with the same capacity as the in-band
         network

      *  Out-of-band networks with less capacity than the in-band
         network

      *  Everything being on the in-band network




Dickinson, et al.         Expires June 9, 2017                  [Page 5]

Internet-Draft     C-DNS: A DNS Packet Capture Format      December 2016


   Thus, there is a wide range of use cases from very limited data
   collection environments (third party hardware, servers that are under
   attack, packet capture on the name server itself and no out-of-band
   network) to "limitless" environments (self hosted, well provisioned
   servers, using a network tap or port mirroring with an out-of-band
   networks with the same capacity as the in-band network).  In the
   former, it is infeasible to reliably collect full packet captures,
   especially if the server is under attack.  In the latter case,
   collection of full packet captures may be reasonable.

   As a result of these restrictions, the C-DNS data format was designed
   with the most limited use case in mind such that:

   o  data collection will occur on the same hardware as the name server
      itself

   o  collected data will be stored on the same hardware as the name
      server itself, at least temporarily

   o  collected data being returned to some central analysis system will
      use the same network interface as the DNS queries and responses

   o  there can be multiple third party servers involved

   Because of these considerations, a major factor in the design of the
   format is minimal storage size of the capture files.

   Another significant consideration for any application that records
   DNS traffic is that the running of the name server software and the
   transmission of DNS queries and responses are the most important jobs
   of a name server; capturing data is not.  Any data collection system
   co-located with the name server needs to be intelligent enough to
   carefully manage its CPU, disk, memory and network utilization.  This
   leads to designing a format that requires a relatively low overhead
   to produce and minimizes the requirement for further potentially
   costly compression.

   However, it was also essential that interoperability with less
   restricted infrastructure was maintained.  In particular, it is
   highly desirable that the collection format should facilitate the re-
   creation of common formats (such as PCAP) that are as close to the
   original as is realistic given the restrictions above.

4.  Design Considerations

   This section presents some of the major design considerations used in
   the development of the C-DNS format.

   o  The basic unit of data is a combined DNS Query and the associated
      Response (a "Q/R data item").  The same structure will be used for
      unmatched Queries and Responses.  Queries without Responses will
      be captured omitting the response data.  Responses without queries
      will be captured omitting the Query data (but using the Question
      section from the response, if present, as an identifying QNAME).

   Rationale: A Query and Response represents the basic level of a
   clients interaction with the server.  Also, combining the Query and
   Response into one item often reduces storage requirements due to
   commonality in the data of the two messages.

   o  Each Q/R data item will comprise a default Q/R data description
      and a set of optional sections.  Inclusion of optional sections
      shall be configurable.

   Rationale: Different users will have different requirements for data
   to be available for analysis.  Users with minimal requirements should
   not have to pay the cost of recording full data, however this will
   limit the ability to reconstruct packet captures.  For example,
   omitting the resource records from a Response will reduce the files
   size, and in principle responses can be synthesized if there is
   enough context.

   o  Multiple Q/R data items will be collected into blocks in the
      format.  Common data in a block will be abstracted and referenced
      from individual Q/R data items by indexing.  The maximum number of
      Q/R data items in a block will be configurable.

   Rationale: This blocking and indexing provides a significant
   reduction in the volume of file data generated.  Although this
   introduces complexity, it provides compression of the data that makes
   use of knowledge of the DNS packet structure.

   [TODO: Further discussion on commonality between DNS packets e.g.

   o  common query signatures

   o  for the authoritative case, there are a finite set of valid
      responses and much commonality in NXDOMAIN responses]

   It is anticipated that the files produced can be subject to further
   compression using general purpose compression tools.  Measurements
   show that blocking significantly reduces the CPU required to perform
   such strong compression.  See Appendix C.2.

   o  Metadata about other packets received can optionally be included
      in each block.  For example, counts of malformed DNS packets and



Dickinson, et al.         Expires June 9, 2017                  [Page 7]

Internet-Draft     C-DNS: A DNS Packet Capture Format      December 2016


      non-DNS packets (e.g.  ICMP, TCP resets) sent to the server may be
      of interest.

   o  Malformed packets will, where possible, be matched with the
      corresponding query or response, with the match flagged to
      indicate the presence of malformed input.  The original content of
      malformed packets will optionally be recorded.

      *  For example if a query is malformed and no matching attempt is
         made, this will lead to the (well formed) DNS responses with
         error code FORMERR appearing as "unmatched".

      *  Any structured capture format that does not capture the DNS
         payload byte for byte will be limited to some extent in that it
         cannot represent "malformed" DNS packets.  Only those packets
         that can be transformed reasonably into the structured format
         can be represented by the format.

      *  Malformed packets are discussed in more detail in Section 5.

   Rationale: Many name servers will process queries on a best-effort
   basis in accordance with Postel's Law, and do not insist on
   completely well-formed packets.  If possible, responses to these
   queries should be matched with the query, so that the query does not
   appear to have gone un-answered in name server performance reporting.
   It can be advantageous to collect statistics on malformed inputs, and
   possibly to analyse those inputs.  Therefore it should be possible to
   record malformed packet contents directly in the C-DNS format.

5.  Malformed Packets

   As the primary aim of handling malformed packets is to match
   responses and queries as far as possible despite the malformation,
   malformed packets are divided into two distinct types; those packets
   which can be decoded sufficiently to allow matching with a
   corresponding query or response ("partially malformed"), and those
   that cannot ("completely malformed").

   The approach adopted in C-DNS to matching query and response is
   described in Section 10.1.  To be matched, it must be possible to
   decode the Primary ID (see Section 10.2.1), and, if present, the
   Secondary ID (see Section 10.2.2).  Briefly, it must be possible to
   decode the IP source and destination addresses, the UDP or TCP source
   and destination ports, the DNS header ID, the DNS header
   flags/opcode/rcode fields, QDCOUNT, and, if QDCOUNT is non-zero, the
   entire DNS header and the first question section entry.  If these
   cannot be decoded, matching cannot proceed, and the packet is
   therefore classified as completely malformed.  If these can be

Internet-Draft     C-DNS: A DNS Packet Capture Format      December 2016


   decoded, the packet is classified as partially malformed, and
   participates in matching.  See Section 10.10 for more on matching
   with partially malformed packets.

   If recording the content of malformed packets in C-DNS is enabled,
   the original packet content of both completely and partially
   malformed packets is recorded in C-DNS.  The data is tagged to
   indicate whether the packet was processed as completely or partially
   malformed.

   A count of malformed packets is in a block is kept in the C-DNS block
   statistics.  This is a single count, including both partially and
   completely malformed packets.

7.  Choice of CBOR

   This document presents a detailed format description using CBOR, the
   Concise Binary Object Representation defined in [RFC7049].

   The choice of CBOR was made taking a number of factors into account.

   o  CBOR is a binary representation, and thus is economical in storage
      space.

   o  Other binary representations were investigated, and whilst all had
      attractive features, none had a significant advantage over CBOR.
      See Appendix C for some discussion of this.

   o  CBOR is an IETF standard and familiar to IETF participants.  It is
      based on the now-common ideas of lists and objects, and thus
      requires very little familiarization for those in the wider
      industry.

Internet-Draft     C-DNS: A DNS Packet Capture Format      December 2016


   o  CBOR is a simple format, and can easily be implemented from
      scratch if necessary.  More complex formats require library
      support which may present problems on unusual platforms.

   o  CBOR can also be easily converted to text formats such as JSON
      ([RFC7159]) for debugging and other human inspection requirements.

   o  CBOR data schemas can be described using CDDL
      [I-D.greevenbosch-appsawg-cbor-cddl].

8.  The C-DNS format

8.1.  CDDL definition

   The CDDL definition for the C-DNS format is given in Appendix A.

8.2.  Format overview

   A C-DNS file begins with a file header containing a file type
   identifier and a preamble.  The preamble contains information on the
   collection settings.

   The file header is followed by a series of data blocks.

   A block consists of a block header, containing various tables of
   common data, and some statistics for the traffic received over the
   block.  The block header is then followed by a list of the Q/R data
   items detailing the queries and responses received during processing
   of the block input.  The list of Q/R data items is in turn followed
   by a list of per-client counts of particular IP events that occurred
   during collection of the block data.

   The exact nature of the DNS data will affect what block size is the
   best fit, however sample data for a root server indicated that block
   sizes up to 10,000 Q/R data items give good results.  See
   Appendix C.6 for more details.

   If no field type is specified, then the field is unsigned.

   In all quantities that contain bit flags, bit 0 indicates the least
   significant bit.  An item described as an index is the index of the
   Q/R data item in the referenced table.  Indexes are 1-based.  An
   index value of 0 is reserved to mean "not present".

8.9.  Block table map

   The block table map contains the block tables.  Each element, or
   table, is an array.  The following tables detail the contents of each
   block table.

   The Present column in the following tables indicates the
   circumstances when an optional field will be present.  A Q/R data
   item may be:

   o  A Query plus a Response.

   o  A Query without a Response.

   o  A Response without a Query.

   Also:

   o  A Query and/or a Response may contain an OPT section.

Internet-Draft     C-DNS: A DNS Packet Capture Format      December 2016


   o  A Question may or may not be present.  If the Query is available,
      the Question section of the Query is used.  If no Query is
      available, the Question section of the Response is used.  Unless
      otherwise noted, a Question refers to the first Question in the
      Question section.

   So, for example, a field listed with a Present value of QUERY is
   present whenever the Q/R data item contains a Query.  If the pair
   contains a Response only, the field will not be present.

8.10.  IP address table

   This table holds all client and server IP addresses in the block.
   Each item in the table is a single IP address.

   +---------+--------+------------------------------------------------+
   | Field   | Type   | Description                                    |

   | Address | Byte   | The IP address, in network byte order. The     |
   |         | string | string is 4 bytes long for an IPv4 address, 16 |
   |         |        | bytes long for an IPv6 address.                |

9.  C-DNS to PCAP

   It is possible to re-construct PCAP files from the C-DNS format in a
   lossy fashion.  Some of the issues with reconstructing both the DNS
   payload and the full packet stream are outlined here.





Dickinson, et al.         Expires June 9, 2017                 [Page 24]

Internet-Draft     C-DNS: A DNS Packet Capture Format      December 2016


   The reconstruction depends on whether or not all the optional
   sections of both the query and response were captured in the C-DNS
   file.  Clearly, if they were not all captured, the reconstruction
   will be imperfect.

   Even if all sections of the response were captured, one cannot
   reconstruct the DNS response payload exactly due to the fact that
   some DNS names in the message on the wire may have been compressed.
   Section 9.1 discusses this is more detail.

   Some transport information is not captured in the C-DNS format.  For
   example, the following aspects of the original packet stream cannot
   be re-constructed from the C-DNS format:

   o  IP fragmentation

   o  TCP stream information:

      *  Multiple DNS messages may have been sent in a single TCP
         segment

      *  A DNS payload may have be split across multiple TCP segments

      *  Multiple DNS messages may have be sent on a single TCP session

   o  Malformed DNS messages if they are not recorded

   Simple assumptions can be made on the reconstruction: fragmented and
   DNS-over-TCP messages can be reconstructed into single packets and a
   single TCP session can be constructed for each TCP packet.

   Additionally, if malformed packets are captured in the C-DNS or
   separate packet captures, they can be merged with packet captures
   reconstructed from C-DNS to produce a more complete packet stream.

9.1.  Name Compression

   All the names stored in the C-DNS format are full domain names; no
   DNS style name compression is used on the individual names within the
   format.  Therefore when reconstructing a packet, name compression
   must be used in order to reproduce the on the wire representation of
   the packet.

   [RFC1035] name compression works by substituting trailing sections of
   a name with a reference back to the occurrence of those sections
   earlier in the packet.  Not all name server software uses the same
   algorithm when compressing domain names within the responses.  Some
   attempt maximum recompression at the expense of runtime resources,



Dickinson, et al.         Expires June 9, 2017                 [Page 25]

Internet-Draft     C-DNS: A DNS Packet Capture Format      December 2016


   others use heuristics to balance compression and speed and others use
   different rules for what is a valid compression target.

   This means that responses to the same question from different name
   server software which match in terms of DNS payload content (header,
   counts, RRs with name compression removed) do not necessarily match
   byte-for-byte on the wire.

   Therefore, it is not possible to ensure that the DNS response payload
   is reconstructed byte-for-byte from C-DNS data.  However, it can at
   least, in principle, be reconstructed to have the correct payload
   length (since the original response length is captured) if there is
   enough knowledge of the commonly implemented name compression
   algorithms.  For example, a simplistic approach would be to try each
   algorithm in turn to see if it reproduces the original length,
   stopping at the first match.  This would not guarantee the correct
   algorithm has been used as it is possible to match the length whilst
   still not matching the on the wire bytes but, without further
   information added to the C-DNS data, this is the best that can be
   achieved.

   Appendix B presents an example of two different compression
   algorithms used by well-known name server software.

10.  Data Collection

   This section describes a non-normative proposed algorithm for the
   processing of a captured stream of DNS queries and responses and
   matching queries/responses where possible.

   For the purposes of this discussion, it is assumed that the input has
   been pre-processed such that:

   1.  All IP fragmentation reassembly, TCP stream reassembly, and so
       on, has already been performed

   2.  Each message is associated with transport metadata required to
       generate the Primary ID (see Section 10.2.1)

   3.  Each message has a well-formed DNS header of 12 bytes and (if
       present) the first RR in the Question section can be parsed to
       generate the Secondary ID (see below).  As noted earlier, this
       requirement can result in a malformed query being removed in the
       pre-processing stage, but the correctly formed response with
       RCODE of FORMERR being present.

Internet-Draft     C-DNS: A DNS Packet Capture Format      December 2016


   DNS messages are processed in the order they are delivered to the
   application.  It should be noted that packet capture libraries do not
   necessary provide packets in strict chronological order.

   [TODO: Discuss the corner cases resulting from this in more detail.]

10.1.  Matching algorithm

   A schematic representation of the algorithm for matching Q/R data
   items is shown in the following diagram:

   Figure showing the packet matching algorithm format (PNG) [5]

   Figure showing the packet matching algorithm format (SVG) [6]

   Further details of the algorithm are given in the following sections.

10.2.  Message identifiers

10.2.1.  Primary ID

   A Primary ID can be constructed for each message which is composed of
   the following data:

   1.  Source IP Address

   2.  Destination IP Address

   3.  Source Port

   4.  Destination Port

   5.  Transport

   6.  DNS Message ID

10.2.2.  Secondary ID

   If present, the first question in the Question section is used as a
   secondary ID for each message.  Note that some queries and some
   responses may have a QDCOUNT of 0 (for example, responses with
   RCODE=FORMERR or NOTIMP).  In this case the secondary ID is not used
   in matching.

10.3.  Algorithm Parameters

   1.  Configurable timeout

10.4.  Algorithm Requirements

   The algorithm is designed to handle the following input data:

   1.  Multiple queries with the same Primary ID (but different
       Secondary ID) arriving before any responses for these queries are
       seen.

   2.  Multiple queries with the same Primary and Secondary ID arriving
       before any responses for these queries are seen.

   3.  Queries for which no later response can be found within the
       specified timeout.

   4.  Responses for which no previous query can be found within the
       specified timeout.

10.5.  Algorithm Limitations

   For cases 1 and 2 listed in the above requirements, it is not
   possible to unambiguously match queries with responses.  This
   algorithm chooses to match to the earliest query with the correct
   Primary and Secondary ID.

10.6.  Workspace

   A FIFO structure is used to hold the Q/R data items during
   processing.

10.7.  Matching Queries and Responses

   If a response has a Secondary ID, it matches the earliest query with
   the same Primary and Secondary IDs.  If a response does not have a
   Secondary ID, it matches the earliest query with the same Primary ID,
   regardless of whether that query has a Secondary ID or not.

   A query that does not have a Secondary ID can only be matched by a
   response that does not have a Secondary ID.

10.8.  Output

   The output is a list of Q/R data items.  Both the Query and Response
   elements are optional in these items, therefore Q/R data items have
   one of three types of content:



Dickinson, et al.         Expires June 9, 2017                 [Page 28]

Internet-Draft     C-DNS: A DNS Packet Capture Format      December 2016


   1.  A matched pair of query and response messages

   2.  A query message with no response

   3.  A response message with no query

   The timestamp of a list item is that of the query for cases 1 and 2
   and that of the response for case 3.

10.9.  Post Processing

   When ending capture, all remaining entries in the Q/R data item FIFO
   should be treated as timed out queries.

10.10.  Malformed Packet Considerations

   As noted in Section 5, partially malformed packets go through query
   and response matching.  They have a Primary ID, and possibly a
   Secondary ID, and can be matched in the same way as well-formed
   packets.

   When a partially malformed packet is matched, the Q/R data item
   generated by this process must be populated with the information in
   the Primary ID, the Secondary ID (if relevant) and the packet
   timestamp, and a flag set to indicate that the packet was malformed
   and the Q/R data item may therefore be incomplete.  All other fields
   in the Q/R data item are optional, and so may be omitted.
   Implementations may choose to include the contents of other decoded
   fields from the partially malformed packet in the Q/R data item.

   Completely malformed packets do not go through query and response
   matching, and so do not generate a Q/R data item.

11.  IANA Considerations

   None

12.  Security Considerations

   Any control interface MUST perform authentication and encryption.

   Any data upload MUST be authenticated and encrypted.

Appendix B.  DNS Name compression example

   The basic algorithm, which follows the guidance in [RFC1035], is
   simply to collect each name, and the offset in the packet at which it
   starts, during packet construction.  As each name is added, it is
   offered to each of the collected names in order of collection,
   starting from the first name.  If labels at the end of the name can
   be replaced with a reference back to part (or all) of the earlier
   name, and if the uncompressed part of the name is shorter than any
   compression already found, the earlier name is noted as the
   compression target for the name.

   The following tables illustrate the process.  In an example packet,
   the first name is example.com.

          +---+-------------+--------------+--------------------+
          | N | Name        | Uncompressed | Compression Target |
          +---+-------------+--------------+--------------------+
          | 1 | example.com |              |                    |
          +---+-------------+--------------+--------------------+

   The next name added is bar.com.  This is matched against example.com.
   The com part of this can be used as a compression target, with the
   remaining uncompressed part of the name being bar.

          +---+-------------+--------------+--------------------+
          | N | Name        | Uncompressed | Compression Target |
          +---+-------------+--------------+--------------------+
          | 1 | example.com |              |                    |
          | 2 | bar.com     | bar          | 1 + offset to com  |
          +---+-------------+--------------+--------------------+

   The third name added is www.bar.com.  This is first matched against
   example.com, and as before this is recorded as a compression target,
   with the remaining uncompressed part of the name being www.bar.  It
   is then matched against the second name, which again can be a
   compression target.  Because the remaining uncompressed part of the
   name is www, this is an improved compression, and so it is adopted.

          +---+-------------+--------------+--------------------+
          | N | Name        | Uncompressed | Compression Target |
          +---+-------------+--------------+--------------------+
          | 1 | example.com |              |                    |
          | 2 | bar.com     | bar          | 1 + offset to com  |
          | 3 | www.bar.com | www          | 2                  |
          +---+-------------+--------------+--------------------+

   As an optimization, if a name is already perfectly compressed (in
   other words, the uncompressed part of the name is empty), then no
   further names will be considered for compression.

B.1.  NSD compression algorithm

   Using the above basic algorithm the packet lengths of responses
   generated by NSD [8] can be matched almost exactly.  At the time of
   writing, a tiny number (<.01%) of the reconstructed packets had
   incorrect lengths.

B.2.  Knot Authoritative compression algorithm

   The Knot Authoritative [9] name server uses different compression
   behavior, which is the result of internal optimization designed to
   balance runtime speed with compression size gains.  In brief, and
   omitting complications, Knot Authoritative will only consider the
   QNAME and names in the immediately preceding RR section in an RRSET
   as compression targets.

   A set of smart heuristics as described below can be implemented to
   mimic this and while not perfect it produces output nearly, but not
   quite, as good a match as with NSD.  The heuristics are:

   1.  A match is only perfect if the name is completely compressed AND
       the TYPE of the section in which the name occurs matches the TYPE
       of the name used as the compression target.

   2.  If the name occurs in RDATA:

       *  If the compression target name is in a query, then only the
          first RR in an RRSET can use that name as a compression
          target.

       *  The compression target name MUST be in RDATA.

       *  The name section TYPE must match the compression target name
          section TYPE.

       *  The compression target name MUST be in the immediately
          preceding RR in the RRSET.

   Using this algorithm less than 0.1% of the reconstructed packets had
   incorrect lengths.

B.3.  Observed differences

   In sample traffic collected on a root name server around 2-4% of
   responses generated by Knot had different packet lengths to those
   produced by NSD.

Appendix C.  Comparison of Binary Formats

   Several binary serialisation formats were considered, and for
   completeness were also compared to JSON.

   o  Apache Avro [10].  Data is stored according to a pre-defined
      schema.  The schema itself is always included in the data file.
      Data can therefore be stored untagged, for a smaller serialisation
      size, and be written and read by an Avro library.

      *  At the time of writing, Avro libraries are available for C,
         C++, C#, Java, Python, Ruby and PHP.  Optionally tools are
         available for C++, Java and C# to generate code for encoding
         and decoding.

   o  Google Protocol Buffers [11].  Data is stored according to a pre-
      defined schema.  The schema is used by a generator to generate



Dickinson, et al.         Expires June 9, 2017                 [Page 40]

Internet-Draft     C-DNS: A DNS Packet Capture Format      December 2016


      code for encoding and decoding the data.  Data can therefore be
      stored untagged, for a smaller serialisation size.  The schema is
      not stored with the data, so unlike Avro cannot be read with a
      generic library.

      *  Code must be generated for a particular data schema to to read
         and write data using that schema.  At the time of writing, the
         Google code generator can currently generate code for encoding
         and decoding a schema for C++, Go, Java, Python, Ruby, C#,
         Objective-C, Javascript and PHP.

   o  CBOR [12].  Defined in [RFC7049], this serialisation format is
      comparable to JSON but with a binary representation.  It does not
      use a pre-defined schema, so data is always stored tagged.
      However, CBOR data schemas can be described using CDDL
      [I-D.greevenbosch-appsawg-cbor-cddl] and tools exist to verify
      data files conform to the schema.

      *  CBOR is a simple format, and simple to implement.  At the time
         of writing, the CBOR website lists implementations for 16
         languages.

   Avro and Protocol Buffers both allow storage of untagged data, but
   because they rely on the data schema for this, their implementation
   is considerably more complex than CBOR.  Using Avro or Protocol
   Buffers in an unsupported environment would require notably greater
   development effort compared to CBOR.

   A test program was written which reads input from an input PCAP file
   and writes output using two basic structures; a simple structure,
   where each query/response pair is represented in a single record
   entry, and the C-DNS block structure.

   The resulting output files were then compressed using a variety of
   common general-purpose lossless compression tools to explore the
   compressibility of the formats.  The compression tools employed were:

   o  snzip [13].  A command line compression tool based on the Google
      Snappy [14] library.

   o  lz4 [15].  The command line compression tool from the reference C
      LZ4 implementation.

   o  gzip [16].  The ubiquitous GNU zip tool.

   o  zstd [17].  Compression using the Zstandard algorithm.

   o  xz [18].  A popular compression tool noted for high compression.

Internet-Draft     C-DNS: A DNS Packet Capture Format      December 2016


   In all cases the compression tools were run using their default
   settings.

   Note that this draft does not mandate the use of compression, nor any
   particular compression scheme, but it anticipates that in practice
   output data will be subject to general-purpose compression, and so
   this should be taken into consideration.

   "test.pcap", a 662Mb capture of sample data from a root instance was
   used for the comparison.  The following table shows the formatted
   size and size after compression (both in Mb), together with the task
   resident set size (RSS) in kb and the user time in seconds taken by
   the compression.

   The above results are discussed in the following sections.

C.1.  Comparison with full PCAP files

   An important first consideration is whether moving away from PCAP
   offers significant benefits.

   The simple binary formats are typically larger than PCAP, even though
   they omit some information such as Ethernet MAC addresses.  But not
   only do they require less CPU to compress than PCAP, the resulting
   compressed files are smaller than compressed PCAP.

C.2.  Simple versus block coding

   The intention of the block coding is to perform data de-duplication
   on query/response records within the block.  The simple and block
   formats above store exactly the same information for each query/
   response record.  This information is parsed from the DNS traffic in
   the input PCAP file, and in all cases each field has an identifier
   and the field data is typed.

   The data de-duplication on the block formats show an order of
   magnitude reduction in the size of the format file size against the
   simple formats.  As would be expected, the compression tools are able



Dickinson, et al.         Expires June 9, 2017                 [Page 43]

Internet-Draft     C-DNS: A DNS Packet Capture Format      December 2016


   to find and exploit a lot of this duplication, but as the de-
   duplication process uses knowledge of DNS traffic, it is able to
   retain a size advantage.  This advantage reduces as stronger
   compression is applied, as again would be expected, but even with the
   strongest compression applied the block formatted data remains around
   75% of the size of the simple format and its compression requires
   roughly a third of the CPU time.

C.3.  Binary versus text formats

   Text data formats offer many advantages over binary formats,
   particularly in the areas of ad-hoc data inspection and extraction.
   It was therefore felt worthwhile to carry out a direct comparison,
   implementing JSON versions of the simple and block formats.

   Concentrating on JSON block format, the format files produced are a
   significant fraction of an order of magnitude larger than binary
   formats.  The impact on file size after compression is as might be
   expected from that starting point; the stronger compression produces
   files that are 150% of the size of similarly compressed binary
   format, and require over 4x more CPU to compress.

C.4.  Performance

   Concentrating again on the block formats, all three produce format
   files that are close to an order of magnitude smaller that the
   original "test.pcap" file.  CBOR produces the largest files and Avro
   the smallest, 20% smaller than CBOR.

   However, once compression is taken into account, the size difference
   narrows.  At medium compression (with gzip), the size difference is
   4%.  Using strong compression (with xz) the difference reduces to 2%,
   with Avro the largest and Protocol Buffers the smallest, although
   CBOR and Protocol Buffers require slightly more compression CPU.

   The measurements presented above do not include data on the CPU
   required to generate the format files.  Measurements indicate that
   writing Avro requires 10% more CPU than CBOR or Protocol Buffers.  It
   appears, therefore, that Avro's advantage in compression CPU usage is
   probably offset by a larger CPU requirement in writing Avro.

C.5.  Conclusions

   The above assessments lead us to the choice of a binary format file
   using blocking.

   As noted previously, this draft anticipates that output data will be
   subject to compression.  There is no compelling case for one



Dickinson, et al.         Expires June 9, 2017                 [Page 44]

   particular binary serialisation format in terms of either final file
   size or machine resources consumed, so the choice must be largely
   based on other factors.  CBOR was chosen as the binary serialisation
   format for the following reasons:

   o  Simplicity of implementation and consequent lack of reliance on
      library and/or code generator availability.

   o  IETF standardisation.

   o  Close resemblance to JSON and thus accessibility to a wider
      industry beyond IETF.

C.6.  Block size choice

   Given the choice of a CBOR format using blocking, the question arises
   of what an appropriate default value for the maximum number of query/
   response pairs in a block should be.  This has two components; what
   is the impact on performance of using different block sizes in the
   format file, and what is the impact on the size of the format file
   before and after compression.

   The following table addresses the performance question, showing the
   impact on the performance of a C++ program converting "test.pcap" to
   C-DNS.  File size is in Mb, resident set size (RSS) in kb.

              +------------+-----------+--------+-----------+
              | Block size | File size |    RSS | User time |
              +------------+-----------+--------+-----------+
              |       1000 |    133.46 | 612.27 |     15.25 |
              |       5000 |     89.85 | 676.82 |     14.99 |
              |      10000 |     76.87 | 752.40 |     14.53 |
              |      20000 |     67.86 | 750.75 |     14.49 |
              |      40000 |     61.88 | 736.30 |     14.29 |
              |      80000 |     58.08 | 694.16 |     14.28 |
              |     160000 |     55.94 | 733.84 |     14.44 |
              |     320000 |     54.41 | 799.20 |     13.97 |
              +------------+-----------+--------+-----------+

   Increasing block size, therefore, tends to increase maximum RSS a
   little, with no significant effect (if anything a small reduction) on
   CPU consumption.

   The following figure plots the effect of increasing block size on
   output file size for different compressions.

   From the above, there is obviously scope for tuning the default block
   size to the compression being employed, traffic characteristics,
   frequency of output file rollover etc.  Using a strong compression,
   block sizes over 10,000 query/response pairs would seem to offer
   limited improvements.

Appendix D.  Notes to implementors

D.1.  Malformed packets

   In the presence of malformed packets where one or more of QDCOUNT,
   ANCOUNT, NSCOUNT and ARCOUNT do not match the RRs that can be
   successfully decoded, the query signature should contain the values
   of the counts from the DNS header, and the query/response record
   should contain the successfully decoded RRs.  Beware, therefore, that
   the counts as recorded are not a reliable guide to the number of RRs
   associated with the query/response.

D.2.  Block preamble timestamp

   The timestamp in the block preamble gives the timestamp of the
   earliest query/response or malformed packet record in the block.
   Query/response records and malformed packet records specify their
   timestamp as an offset from this timestamp.  This offset is always
   positive.  Since, as already noted above in Section 10, packet
   capture libraries do not necessarily provide packets in strict
   chronological order, the earliest item in the block will not
   necessarily be the first item.
