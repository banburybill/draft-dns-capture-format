Building
--------

To generate the txt from the markdown use [GNUmake](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/):

    $ make

Output HTML and TXT files will be placed in subdirectory `draft-<version>`.
These files will be named with the draft revision to ease working with IETF tools.

You will need:

* [mmark](https://github.com/miekg/mmark)
* [xml2rfc](https://xml2rfc.tools.ietf.org)

`*.odg` files are [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) Draw files.

Build Artifacts
---------------

All build artifacts that get checked in should be checked into a
subdirectory `draft-<version>`. Build artifacts not generated by `make`
are:

* Graphics files generated from checked-in sources. .png and
  .svg are generated using the LibreOffice export, and in the case
  of .png taking the default size options.
