Building
--------

To generate text and html versions of the draft from the markdown use
[GNUmake](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/):

    $ make

Output HTML and TXT files will be placed in subdirectory
`draft-<version>`. These files will be named with the draft revision
to ease working with IETF tools. The graphics will also be
converted from `*.odg` files are [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/)
Draw files to PNG and SVG files in the `draft-<version>` subdirectory.

You will need:

* [mmark](https://github.com/miekg/mmark)
* [xml2rfc](https://xml2rfc.tools.ietf.org)
* [unoconv](https://github.com/dagwieers/unoconv)

All the above are available via `apt` on Ubuntu Xenial and via `brew`
on MacOS. However, `unoconv` on MacOS does not currently work with
LibreOffice 5.x; if on Mac you will have to build the graphics by
hand as described below. It is possible that if you have LibreOffice
4.x installed that unoconv will work.

Build Artifacts
---------------

All build artifacts that get checked in should be checked into a
subdirectory `draft-<version>`. You should check in HTML and TXT outputs
and the generated graphics files as these are served from GitHub.

Build artifacts not generated by `make` on Mac are:

* Graphics files generated from checked-in sources. .png and
  .svg are generated using the LibreOffice export, and in the case
  of .png taking the default size options.
